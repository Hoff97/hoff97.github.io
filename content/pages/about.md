Title: About

My name is Frithjof Winkelmann, I am a Software Engineer at Argo AI
working on Prediction. I am particularly interested in uncertainty estimation
 - and what to do with it once you have it. Previously I completed my masters at the
Technical University of Munich.
On this blog I will occasionally post stuff I'm interested in.
